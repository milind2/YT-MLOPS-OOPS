1. class and object
2. class has attribute/variable & function/method
3. why python is called OOP ? everthing in python is object/class. if your type(datatype) -> will show you class dataype.
4. Advantages for oops
    > You can create your own datatypes
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colaborate

5. Understanding imports in python:
   when we import something like from sklearn.preprocessing import train_test_split
   here 'sklearn' is folder, in this folder there is file with name preprocessing and from this file import class train_test_split

    ex- from oops_proj import chatbook
    in this example oops_proj is file name and from this file we imported a class chatbook
